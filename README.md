# EggTimer

The EggTimer application allows us to calculate the cooking time with the Timer to adjust the egg to the consistency we want. We use the progressView to see the percentage of the completed task, and finally we import the framework called AVFoundation and complete our first swift application that gives a warning sound at the end of the time.
